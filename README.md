# SimpleComputeParticles

Simple program that simulates a big number of particles inside a cube with variant attractors.
The boiler plate vulkan code has been abstracted in a minimalist fashion with only the few features / structures needed.

The aim of the project was to get started with the Vulkan API and compute shaders before tackling more impressive simulation!!! A small UI example is implemented as well as a camera.
